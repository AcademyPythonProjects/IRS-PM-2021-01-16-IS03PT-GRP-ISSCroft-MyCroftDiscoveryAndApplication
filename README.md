## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

This project is to discover the data privacy handling, architecture, main components of Mycroft, interactions of components to make functionality and experiments on software and hardware tools for it. Main components are Wake Word Detection, Speech to Text (STT), Intent Parser, Text to Speech (TTS), Middleware (Mycroft core, home and API) and Skills. In addition, to set-up Mycroft core in devices like Mycroft Linux and Picroft (Raspberry PI based) followed by skill operation interfacing with Mycroft server and Personal server (setup based on Mycroft server), it brings all components together to fulfil the expected functionalities and experiments and can be treated as infrastructure for future exploration and usage.

Furthermore, our project builds customized skills as use cases which are running against devices (Mycroft Linux and Picroft) interfacing both Mycroft server and Personal server. And we also develop routes optimized parcel delivery system which is a REST API-enabled system to be called by skill to perform designed functions against Mycroft infrastructure.

The bright spot of the project is to document the standard setup along with detailed instructions which will speed up new user and developer onboarding Mycroft. And defined use cases enhanced the understanding about the Mycroft framework which can be used for future application. In addition, developed routes optimized parcel delivery system and applied skill running against Personal server is obviously extending the scope of Mycroft usage and bringing more value therefore potential attracting more focusing from users.
